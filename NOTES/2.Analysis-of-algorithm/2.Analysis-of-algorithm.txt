Algorithm
    An algorithm is the step by step instruction to solve a given problem.
    Example:-

        sum(n): Algorithm to add first n natural numbers. Assume s is a variable initialized to 0.

        1. If n<=0 return -1
        2. Repeat step 3 and 4 while n!=0
        3. s=s+n
        4. [decrement n] n--
        5. return s

Analysis Of algorithm  
    the goal of analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithm mainly in terms of running time but also in terms of other factors (like memory, efforts etc).

Rate of growth
    the rate of growth at which the running time increases as a function of input is called rate of growth.

    f(n)= n^4 + 2n^2 + 100n +500

    f(n)= n^4 for some n>n0

Type of Analysis
    To analyze the given algorithm we need to know on what inputs the algorithm is taking less time and on what inputs the algorithm is taking huge time.
        Worst case 
        Average case 
        Best case

Asimptotic Nottions
    For all the three cases we need to identify the upper and lower bounds.
    Syntax of representations of bounds are
        Big-omega notation
        Omega notation
        Theta notation
