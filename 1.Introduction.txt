Variables
    Variables names are the placeholders for representing data.

Data Types
    A data type in a programming language is a set of data with the values having predefined charecteristics.
    System/Compiler defined data type are called primitive data type
    Structure in C/C++ and classes in C++/Java are the means to create our own data type known as user defined data type.

Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

Classification of DS
    Linear Data Structure(Link list, Stack, Queue)
    Non Linear Data Structure(Tree, Graph)

Abstract Data Types
    ALl primitive data types supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
    The system is providing the types we implementation for the primitive data types.
    For non primitive data types we also need to define operations.

    Combination of data Structure and their operations are known as Abstract Data Type.
    So, data structure is all about creating Abstract Data Types
    Any piece of information can be handled by defining appropriate data type and set of operations.
